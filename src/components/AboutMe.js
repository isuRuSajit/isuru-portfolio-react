                I am an undergraduate, currently following a B.Sc (Hons)
                Information Technology degree offered by SLIIT at Malabe. I am a
                well-organized, collaborative team player with strong
                communication and analytical skills. I consider every challenge
                I get as an opportunity to improve my skills. I would like to
                use my skills to contribute productively and positively to
                fulfill the goals of the organization while improving my
                knowledge through hands-on learning and development work.
